# Scent Bonanza

## Description

Scent Bonanza is a cutting-edge e-commerce project developed by a team of dedicated students aiming to create a dynamic and user-friendly online platform. The primary goal of this project is to facilitate an accessible, enjoyable, and efficient shopping experience, enabling customers to browse, select, and purchase their favorite perfumes with ease. The website is designed to handle a range of functionalities tailored to consumer needs—from selecting brands and concentrations to managing purchases through an intuitive cart system. Furthermore, the platform will offer promotional discounts during special events and bulk purchases, enhancing the shopping experience and customer satisfaction.As the project unfolds in two main phases—Client Side and Server Side—the team focuses on ensuring robust functionality through the integration of technologies like PHP, MySQL, and XML for backend operations and security measures. This comprehensive approach ensures a secure, reliable, and scalable solution that not only meets the current e-commerce demands but also anticipates future expansions and integrations.
